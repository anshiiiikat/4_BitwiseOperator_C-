# Aim
To:

Understand how bitwise operators work in C++

Learn how to set (turn ON) and reset (turn OFF) specific bits in a number

# Objectives
 Use basic bitwise operators like &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

 Learn how to change just one bit in a number

 Understand how shifting bits left or right changes the whole value

# Theory:
What Are Bitwise Operators?
Every number is made of bits (0s and 1s).

Useful when we want to control specific bits â€” like in LEDs, sensors, switches, flags, etc.
|Operator|Symbol| Description|
|--------|------|------------|
| AND    | &     |  Sets bit to 1 only if both bits are 1|
| OR     |  |    | Sets bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1|
| XOR    |  ^    |Sets bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1|
| NOT    |  ~    |Inverts all bits (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)|
|Left Shift| <<  |Shifts bits to the left, multiplying by 2|
|Right Shift| >> |Shifts bits to the right, dividing by 2|
